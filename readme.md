# **_WAV Player_**
### This program demonstrates the [RSound](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rsound/index.html) package, along with GUI applications in racket

## Purpose of this program:
This program is a simple program which plays WAV media files using the RSound Racket library.

## How to Run:
1. First, you must install the RSound package. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:<br>	"raco pkg install rsound"<br>
2. Additionally, you will need to install the [while-loop](https://docs.racket-lang.org/dyoo-while-loop/index.html) package which can be done by running the following command:<br>"raco pkg install while-loop"<br>

Once you have these packages, you should be able to simply click the run button inside of DrRacket to open the program.

## How to Use:
1. Enter the path to the WAV file (It is very important that the file be a WAV file, this program will not work with any other media types) in the text box.
2. Click Play. The program should begin playing the audio file, and you should see a slider at the bottom which shows the time the song is currently at.
